									Significant business opportunities for RegTech arise from the trade-off between the need to stay compliant with ever-changing regulations and the need to cut costs to remain profitable. Accordingly, most of RegTech today centres around solutions for regulated financial institutions, helping them comply more efficiently and with greater certainty with regulations and improve risk management, while cutting costs. While the market is still developing, the lab will identify areas of RegTech for the industry.
